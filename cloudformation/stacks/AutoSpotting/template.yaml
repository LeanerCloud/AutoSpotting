  Description: "AutoSpotting: automated EC2 Spot market bidder integrated with AutoScaling"
  Parameters:
    AllowedInstanceTypes:
      Default: "*"
      Description: >
        "Comma separated list of allowed instance types for spot, in case you
        may want to limit it to a smaller set of instance types (supports
        globs). Example: 'm4.xlarge,r4.xlarge,m5.*'. If using the default or
        leaving it unset, instances will be chosen by AutoSpotting's instance
        compatibility algorithm based on CPU, memory, disk, etc., basically
        getting you the cheapest available instances that are at least as big as
        your existing ones. Using the 'current' keyword for this paremeter will
        use the instance type configured in the group's launch configuration.
        This is a global value that can be overridden on a per-group basis using
        the 'autospotting_allowed_instance_types' tag set on the AutoScaling
        group, which accepts the same configuration values."
      Type: "String"
    BiddingPolicy:
      AllowedValues:
        - "normal"
        - "aggressive"
      Default: "normal"
      Description: >
        "Policy choice for spot bid. If set to 'normal', we bid at the on-demand
        price of the instance type configured in the launch configuration. If
        set to 'aggressive', we bid by default 10% on top of the current spot
        price(configurable using the 'SpotPricePercentageBuffer' parameter), in
        order avoid significant spot price increases."
      Type: "String"
    CronSchedule:
      Default: "* *"
      Description: >
        "Restrict AutoSpotting to run within a time interval given as a
        simplified cron-like rule format restricted to hours and days of week.
        Example: '9-18 1-5' would run it during the work-week and only within
        the usual 9-18 office hours. This is a global value that can be
        overridden on a per-group basis using the 'autospotting_cron_schedule'
        tag set on the AutoScaling group. The default value '* *' makes it run
        at all times.
      Type: "String"
    CronTimezone:
      Default: "UTC"
      Description: >
        "Sets the timezone in which to check the CronSchedule. Example: If the
        timezone is set to 'UTC' and the CronSchedule is '9-18 1-5' it would start
        the interval at 9am UTC, with the timezone set to 'Europe/London' it would
        start the interval at 9am BST (10am UTC) or 9am GMT (9am UTC) depending on
        daylight savings."

    CronScheduleState:

      Description: >
        "Controls whether or not to run AutoSpotting within a time interval

        it run only outside the defined interval. This is a global value thet
